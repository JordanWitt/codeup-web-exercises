                    an even greater threat to Runeterra, and were defeated only by cunning mortal sorcery. But after
                    centuries of imprisonment, Aatrox was the first to find freedom once more, corrupting and
                    transforming those foolish enough to try and wield the magical weapon that contained his essence.
                    Now, with stolen flesh, he walks Runeterra in a brutal approximation of his previous form, seeking
                    an apocalyptic and long overdue vengeance.</dd>
